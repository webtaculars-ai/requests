# Cookie Handling Mechanism Investigation

## Objective
Investigate the session and cookie handling mechanism within `sessions.py`, focusing on methods that manage cookies across requests and sessions.

## Methods Reviewed

### `merge_cookies`
- **Purpose**: Merges cookies from two sources, typically the session's cookie jar and the request's cookies.
- **Findings**: The investigation revealed that `merge_cookies` does not discriminate between persistent session cookies and request-specific cookies. All cookies provided to the method are merged into the session's cookie jar, contributing to the unintended persistence of request cookies.

### `prepare_request`
- **Purpose**: Prepares the request by attaching all necessary information, including cookies, before sending.
- **Findings**: During the preparation of requests, request-specific cookies are correctly attached to individual requests. However, there's no mechanism in place to prevent these request-specific cookies from being merged into the session's cookie jar, indicating a potential area for fixing the bug.

### Other Methods
- **`send` Method**: Investigate how the response cookies are handled and if request-specific cookies are inadvertently being saved.
  - **Findings**: The `send` method is responsible for handling the response from requests, including extracting and merging response cookies into the session's cookie jar. It was observed that the method does not distinguish between response cookies and request cookies, leading to the inadvertent saving of request-specific cookies into the session.

## Summary of Investigation
The investigation has identified that the core issue stems from a lack of discrimination between request-specific cookies and persistent session cookies. Both `merge_cookies` and the `send` method contribute to this issue by not filtering out request-specific cookies when processing and saving cookies to the session's cookie jar. This flaw in the cookie handling mechanism is the likely cause of the unintended persistence of request cookies across sessions.

## Recommendations for Next Steps
1. Implement a conditional check in `merge_cookies` to ensure only response cookies are merged into the session's cookie jar, effectively filtering out request-specific cookies.
2. Adjust the `send` method to distinguish between request and response cookies, ensuring that only response cookies are processed for persistence in the session's cookie jar.
3. Develop a new unit test to verify that request cookies are not persisted across sessions, which will help prevent regressions and ensure the bug is adequately addressed.
