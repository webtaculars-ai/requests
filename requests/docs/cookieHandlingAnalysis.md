# Cookie Handling Analysis

## Overview

This document outlines the analysis of the cookie handling mechanism within `requests/sessions.py`, focusing on the functionality around line 330, which is suspected to contribute to the issue of cookies persisting across sessions inappropriately.

## Current Implementation

The current implementation at line 330 involves the handling of cookies received in HTTP responses and how they are stored in the session object. Upon receiving a response, cookies from the response are merged into the session's cookie jar.

```python
def merge_cookies(request_cookies, response_cookies):
    # Existing logic that merges response cookies into the session's cookie jar
    session_cookies.update(response_cookies)
```

## Identified Issues

The analysis has identified that the merge operation does not discriminate based on the lifecycle of the request. As a result, all cookies received in responses are indiscriminately stored in the session, leading to unintended persistence of cookies across different sessions.

## Potential Causes

1. **Stateful Cookie Jar**: The session's cookie jar is designed to be stateful across requests within a session. However, this design does not account for the isolation required between different user sessions.

2. **Lack of Clear Mechanism**: There is no explicit mechanism to clear or reset the cookie jar after a request is completed, leading to the accumulation of cookies across requests and sessions.

## Recommendations for Further Action

- Implement a strategy for isolating cookies to their respective request-response lifecycle.
- Explore mechanisms to clear or reset the session's cookie jar after a request is processed, ensuring cookies do not persist across sessions unless explicitly intended.

This analysis will be used as a foundation for designing a solution to the identified issue.
