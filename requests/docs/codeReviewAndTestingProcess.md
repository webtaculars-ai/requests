# Code Review and Testing Process

## Introduction
This document outlines the process for conducting thorough code reviews and testing cycles for changes made to the cookie handling mechanism in the HTTP library project.

## Code Review
- Conduct code reviews using the provided checklist (`peerReviewChecklist.md`).
- Use static code analysis tools configured in `static_analysis_config.yaml` to identify potential issues.
- Reviewers should pay special attention to the handling of cookies in session management and ensure that the changes adhere to security best practices.

## Testing
- Execute all unit tests in the project to ensure no existing functionality is broken.
- Run integration tests focusing on session management and cookie handling, as demonstrated in `test_session_management.py`.
- Perform manual testing scenarios to validate the application's behavior in real-world usage patterns.

## Security Implications
- Any changes to session management and cookie handling must be vetted for security implications, including potential vulnerability to session hijacking or fixation attacks.
- Ensure that secure, HttpOnly, and SameSite attributes are correctly applied to cookies.

## Conclusion
The goal of this process is to ensure that the changes made to the HTTP library maintain the integrity of session management, adhere to security best practices, and do not introduce any regressions or new vulnerabilities.
